Alas. that love. whose view is muffledstill. Should. without eyes. see pathways to his will. Where shall we dine. O me. What fraywas here. Yet tell me not. for I have beard it all.Here's much to do with hate. but more with love.Why. then. O brawlinglove. O loving hate. O any thing. of nothing first create. O heavy lightness. serious vanity. Mis-shapenchaosof well-seeming forms. Feather of lead. bright smoke. cold fire. sick health. Still.waking sleep. that is not what it is. This love feel I. that feel no love in this.Dostthou not laugh. BENVOLIO25810No. coz. I rather weep.ROMEO
