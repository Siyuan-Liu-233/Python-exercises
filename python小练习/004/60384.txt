True. I talk of dreams. Which are the children of an idlebrain. Begot of nothing but vain fantasy. Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind. who wooes Even now the frozen bosomof the north. And. being anger'd. puffs away from thence. Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.BENVOLIO53906This wind. yod talk of. blows us from ourselves. Supper is done. and we shall come too late.ROMEO
