Why. such is love's transgression.Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast. Which thou wiltpropagate. to have it prest With more of thine. this love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.Love is a smoke raised with the fumeof sighs. Being purged. a fire sparklingin lovers'eyes. Being vex'da. sea nourish'dwith lovers'tears. What is it else. a madness most discreet. A chokinggalland a preserving sweet.Farewell. my coz.BENVOLIO13183Soft. I will go along. An if you leave me so. you do me wrong.ROMEO
