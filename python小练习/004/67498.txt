Madam. an hour before the worshipp'dsun Peer'dforth the golden window of the east. A troubled mind draveme to walk abroad. Where. underneath the groveof sycamore That westward rootethfrom the city's side. So early walking did I see your son. Towards him I made. but he was ware of me And stoleinto the covertof the wood. I. measuring his affectionsby my own. That most are busied when they're most alone. Pursuedmy humournot pursuing his. And gladly shunn'dwho gladly fled from me.MONTAGUE3372Many a morning hathhe there been seen. With tears augmentingthe fresh morning dew.Adding to clouds with his deep sighs. But all so soon asthe all-cheering sun Should in the furthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Auroa'sbed. Away from the light stealshome my heavyson. And private in his chamberpenshimself. Shuts up his windows. locks far daylight out And makes himself an artificialnight. Black and portentousmust this humourprove. Unless good counselmay the cause remove.BENVOLIO
