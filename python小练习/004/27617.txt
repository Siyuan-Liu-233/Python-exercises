O. then. I see Queen Mabhath been with you.She is the fairies' midwife. and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman. Drawn with a team of little atomies Athwartmen's noses as they lie asleep. Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders'legs. The cover of the wings of grasshoppers. The tracesof the smallest spider's web. The collars of the moonshine'swaterybeams. Her whip of cricket's bone. the lashof film. Her wagonera small grey-coated gnat. Not so big as a round little worm Prick'dfrom the lazy finger of a maid. Her chariotis an empty hazel-nut Made by the joinersquirrel or old grub. Time out o'mind the fairies'coachmakers.And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers'brains. and then they dream of love. O'ercourtiers'knees. that dream on court'siesstraight. O'er lawyers'fingers. who straight dream on fees. O'er ladies 'lipe. Who straight on kisses dream. Which oftthe angry Mab with blistersplagues. Because their breaths with sweetmeats taintedare. Sometime she gallopso'er a courtier's nose. And then dreams he of smelling out a suit. And sometime she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as a'lies asleep. Then dreams. he of another benefice. Sometime she drivetho'er aãsoldier's neck. And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats. Of breaches. ambuscadoes. Spanish blades. Of healths five-fathom deep. and then anon Drums in his ear. at which he starts and wakes. And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again.This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night. And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs. Which once untangled. much misfortune bodes. This is the hag. when maids lie on their backs. That presses tham and learns them first to bear. Making them women of good carriage. This is sheROMEO60384Peace. peace. Mercutio. peace. Thou talk'st of nothing.MERCUTIO
